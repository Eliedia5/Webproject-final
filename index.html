Hi there! My name is Jaden Burks. <br>I am a 26 year old woman, born and raised in Utah. I have been married to my husband, Ryan Burks, 2 years this October 2024. I currently work for The Home Depot for their Business Systems Analytics department, <a href = "www.linkedin.com/in/jaden-b-a74761239"> My Linked in Profile </a>. I am currently working towards my bachelors in Computer Science.

When it comes to my family, it gets very complicated. This is because my mom and dad are divorced (have been since I was 5), and they are both remarried. On my moms direct side alone I have around 28 cousins, and then on my step-moms side I have a very large extended family. That doesnt include my husbands side, where he has close to 20 cousins as well. With this in mind I have put in a table of my most immediate family, with their relation to me, and what side they are on.
